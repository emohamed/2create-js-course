# Functions

Functions are first class citizens in javascript. 

Functions are objects, so they can be stored in variables, objects, arrays. They can be invoked. They can appear whereever expressions can appear. 

declaring functions:
    
    var add = function (a, b) {
    	return a + b;
    }
    
    add(5, 7);

 0. var add 
 0. function 
 0. (a, b)
 0. { ... }
 0. return

Identical to:

    function add(a, b) {
    	return a + b;
    }

Scope -- local vs global variables

Returns

callbacks

inner functions -- they enjoy access to variables in the scope of the parent functions. They can emulate block scope.
